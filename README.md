# Deep-learning-models-for-Human-Activity-Recognition-Using-Smartphones

This project was part of 'Large scale computing for data analytics' course, part of the MSc in Data Analytics at the University of Glasgow in 2022. The data used for the analysis is from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones. \
In this project, neural network based classifiers are used to identify which time series segments belong to which activity.

### Project Structure
This project is divided into 3. 
1. Using the body acceleration data only, we use a single‐layer neural network to classify activities based on each value of the body acceleration data. 
2. A Keras API 1‐dimensional convolutional neural network is used. 
3. Using all available data, A Keras API 1‐dimensional convolutional neural network is used.
